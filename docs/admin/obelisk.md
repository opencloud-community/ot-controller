# OpenTalk Obelisk

[OpenTalk Obelisk](https://gitlab.opencode.de/opentalk/obelisk) is a service
that functions as a middleware layer, bridging the gap between your SIP gate,
such as Asterisk, and our video conference software. This dedicated client,
streamlines the management of SIP phone dial-in capabilities for administrators.

There is no additional configuration needed for the [OpenTalk Obelisk](https://gitlab.opencode.de/opentalk/obelisk). All you need to do is to set-up the Service, which can be found in the [OpenTalk Obelisk docs](https://gitlab.opencode.de/opentalk/obelisk).
