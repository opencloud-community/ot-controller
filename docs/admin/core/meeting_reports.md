# Meeting Reports

The OpenTalk Controller uses the [typst](https://typst.app/) format
to generate reports in meetings.

Each module can define its own set of reports that it can generate. Modules that
make use of the report functionalty are for example:

- [Meeting Reports](https://docs.opentalk.eu/developer/controller/signaling/community/meeting_report/)
- [Legal Vote (in Enterprise Edition)](https://docs.opentalk.eu/developer/controller/signaling/enterprise/legalvote/)
