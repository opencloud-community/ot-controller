# Identity Provider (Keycloak), deprecated configuration

This page describes how OIDC using Keycloak was configured in the controller.
Generic information for Keycloak and its configuration can be found in the [Keycloak section](keycloak.md).

## Deprecated Keycloak configuration

:::warning

In the past, the OIDC and user search section in the [configuration file](configuration.md) was called [`keycloak`](#deprecated-keycloak-configuration).
Support will be removed in the future, use the separate [`oidc`](oidc.md#configuration) and [`user_search`](user_search.md#user-search-configuration)
sections instead.

:::

The section in the [configuration file](configuration.md) was called `keycloak`.

For configuring user search, see the [User search section](user_search.md).

The `external_id_user_attribute_name` setting is used to configure how Keycloak users resulting from a search and registered
Opentalk users are assigned to each other.
The following assignment strategies are available:

- by Keycloak id (default): This is used if `external_id_user_attribute_name` is not set. Keycloak users are assigned to
  Opentalk users using Keycloak's id field.
- by user attribute: Keycloak must provide a user attribute holding the user IDs. The name of this user attribute must be
  set here in `external_id_user_attribute_name`.

### Examples

[keycloak]
