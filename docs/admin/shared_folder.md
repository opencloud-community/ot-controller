# Shared folders on external storage systems

This feature allows to create shared folders on external storage systems. The
following systems are supported:

- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

## Functionality

When the shared folder is enabled, a folder per meeting room can be created
when the meeting is configured, and shared with other participants during the
meeting.

### Creating a shared folder for a meeting

A shared folder can be created for an existing meeting room. The procedure is:

- A folder is created on the configured external storage system.
- A read-write share for the folder is created with a random password. The
  corresponding link and password will be available to participants with
  moderation permission only.
- A read-only share for the folder is created with a random password. The
  corresponding link and password will be available to all participants.

### Deleting a shared folder from a meeting

When deleting a shared folder from a meeting, this procedure is performed:

- The read-only and the read-write shares are deleted.
- The folder is deleted recursively, including all files that it contains.

### Accessing the shared folder during a meeting

If a folder exists for a meeting at the moment when it is started, the signaling messages
will contain the information required by a client to show the link and the password.

A participant with moderation permissions will see the link and the password for
the read-write share, whereas a participant without moderation permissions will
see the link and the password for the read-only share.

If a participant is assigned moderation permission during the meeting, they will
receive an update message with the read-write link and password. When the moderation
permission gets revoked, an update message with the read-only link is sent to the
client.

## NextCloud

A NextCloud instance can be configured through the [configuration file](configuration.md).

### Configuration fields
