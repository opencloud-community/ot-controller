# Jobs

Jobs can be executed through the command-line in order to perform maintenance tasks. Currently, these jobs are not executed automatically and require manual setup by the administrator. They can be executed via cronjobs or systemd timers, for example.

## Available jobs

### Job: `self-check`

This job does not perform any changes to the system, it simply prints a few log
messages of different severity. Use this job to verify that job execution works
as expected without performing any changes.

Execute with:

```text
opentalk-controller jobs execute self-check
```

Example output:

<!-- begin:fromfile:cli-usage/opentalk-controller-jobs-execute-self-check.md -->

```text
[INFO ] Starting job execution
[INFO ] Loading parameters
[INFO ] Executing self-check job
[INFO ]
[TRACE] Test output in TRACE level
[DEBUG] Test output in DEBUG level
[INFO ] Test output in INFO level
[WARN ] Test output in WARN level
[ERROR] Test output in ERROR level
[INFO ]
[INFO ] Job finished successfully
```

<!-- end:fromfile:cli-usage/opentalk-controller-jobs-execute-self-check.md -->

#### Parameters

The job takes an empty JSON object as its parameter.

The default parameters for the job look like this:

<!-- begin:fromfile:jobs/parameters-self-check.json.md -->

```json
{}
