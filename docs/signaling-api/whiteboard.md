# Whiteboard

## Terminology

- __Space__ The actual whiteboard. Terminology inherited from spacedeck.

## Overview

The whiteboard module allows participants to collaboratively edit a whiteboard (space).

A moderator has to initialize the space for a room with the [`initialize`](#initialize) action.
Once initialized, every participant in a room will get an access URL to the created space via the [`space_url`](#spaceurl) message.

A moderator can snapshot the current state of the space as a PDF document with the [`generate_pdf`](#generatepdf) action.
The access URL to the PDF is sent to every participant in the room.

## Joining the room

When joining a room, the `join_success` message contains the current status of the whiteboard module.

The module data has the following structure:

| Field    | Type     | Required                         | Description                                                   |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status` | `enum`   | yes                              | Either `"not_initialized"`, `"initializing"`, `"initialized"` |
| `url`    | `string` | when `status` is `"initialized"` | The access url to the space of the room                       |

```json
{
    "status": "initialized",
    "url": "https://whiteboard.opentalk.eu/s/0c5a6c7-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```
