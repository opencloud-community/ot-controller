//! Contains the components for a system that allows one of many controllers to be elected as a job executor. There can
//! only be one job executor at a time. In case of a failure, another running controller will take over.
//!
//! An etcd setup is required for the leader election, this system only starts when the `[etcd]` config values are set.
//!
//! The elected job executor reads the configured jobs and their parameters from the database and puts them in a queue
//! based on their schedule. These jobs are then run sequentially from the queue, their progress and logs are saved in
//! the database.
//!
//! The [`JobRunner`](job_runner::JobRunner) is the main entry point to start and manage all related tasks:
//!
//! [`ElectionTask`](election_task::ElectionTask) - Manages the etcd leader election
//! [`JobQueue`](job_queue::JobQueue) - A cron based scheduler that create the job queue entries in etcd
//! [`JobExecutor`](executor_task::JobExecutor) - The task that watches the queue and executes jobs
//! [`ExecutionLogger`](execution_logger::ExecutionLogger) - A logger that writes to the database
//!
